                <span class="bio">Darryl has been a freelance writer since he graduated Highschool in 2008. 
                                He got his start writing for a freelance platform that taught college students how to make extra money in their spare time. 
                                These days Darryl has expanded his writing into writing code. You can find him toiling away in his home office either writing 
                                code or shredding his guitar ðŸŽ¸.
